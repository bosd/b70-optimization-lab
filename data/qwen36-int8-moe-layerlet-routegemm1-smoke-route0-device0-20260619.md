- TP size: `4`.
- Result rows: `1`.
- Route mode/source: `route_jsonl`.
- Quant out-variant available: `True`.
- Route source: `data/qwen36-quark-int8-tp4-routecapture6-routes-rank0-20260611.jsonl`.
- Route records matched: `95`; top-k rows loaded: `95`.
- Route start indices: `0`.
- Prologue-inclusive target: `160.000 us/layerlet`.
- Exactness threshold: `0.000000`.

## Exactness

- Manual staged max abs diff versus `xpu_fused_moe`: `0.000`.
- Scratch `xpu_fused_moe` max abs diff: `0.000`.
- Preallocated staged max abs diff: `0.000`.
- Fused-prologue staged max abs diff: `0.000`.
- Full C++ layerlet max abs diff: `0.000`.

## Timing

- Mean `xpu_fused_moe`: `300.456 us`.
- Mean scratch `xpu_fused_moe`: `244.884 us`.
- Mean preallocated staged: `193.710 us`.
- Mean fused-prologue staged: `260.489 us`.
- Mean full C++ layerlet: `162.958 us`.

## Prologue-Inclusive Gate

- Gate status: `exact_nonreference_candidates_exist_but_gate_not_met`.
- Rows ready for endpoint gate: `0` / `1`.
- Best exact non-reference full-layerlet candidate: `full_layerlet` at `162.958 us` (`1.844x` vs current `xpu_fused_moe`).
- Endpoint promotion allowed by this artifact: `False`.
- Endpoint promotion still requires graph-path tensor capture, accepted-lane quality gates, and a manifest update.

## Decision

- This is a baseline route replay with the current non-fused activation and quantization path.
- The fused-prologue staged path is exact against `xpu_fused_moe` for this route replay.
- The fused-prologue staged path is slower than the simpler preallocated staged path in this full-MoE screen. Do not wire it into the endpoint unless the downstream GEMM ABI can consume prologue offsets directly or the prologue is fused with more downstream work.
- Compare `xpu fused us` with the current budget target of roughly `160 us/layer` for a plausible `200 tok/s` non-speculative lane.
