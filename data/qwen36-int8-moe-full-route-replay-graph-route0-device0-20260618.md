## Graph Replay Timing

These timings capture each preallocated candidate in an XPU graph and time `graph.replay()`. They remain single-device replay diagnostics, not endpoint throughput.

| rows | route start | candidate | status | graph us |
|---:|---:|---|---|---:|
| 1 | 0 | xpu_fused_moe_with_scratch | executed | 790.504 |
| 1 | 0 | preallocated_staged | executed | 929.838 |
| 1 | 0 | fused_prologue_staged | executed | 1164.185 |
| 1 | 0 | fused_prologue_offset_gemm | executed | 856.272 |
| 1 | 0 | fused_prologue_active_offset_gemm | executed | 800.620 |

## Prologue-Inclusive Gate

- Gate status: `exact_nonreference_candidates_exist_but_gate_not_met`.
- Rows ready for endpoint gate: `0` / `1`.
- Best exact non-reference full-layerlet candidate: `preallocated_staged` at `419.234 us` (`1.157x` vs current `xpu_fused_moe`).
- Endpoint promotion allowed by this artifact: `False`.
- Endpoint promotion still requires graph-path tensor capture, accepted-lane quality gates, and a manifest update.

| rows | route start | best exact nonref | best nonref us | speedup vs xpu | target met | status |
|---:|---:|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| 1 | 0 | preallocated_staged | 419.234 | 1.157 | False | best_exact_nonreference_misses_target_layerlet_us |

## Decision

- This is a baseline route replay with the current non-fused activation and quantization path.
- The fused-prologue staged path is exact against `xpu_fused_moe` for this route replay.
- The fused-prologue staged path is slower than the simpler preallocated staged path in this full-MoE screen. Do not wire it into the endpoint unless the downstream GEMM ABI can consume prologue offsets directly or the prologue is fused with more downstream work.
- Compare `xpu fused us` with the current budget target of roughly `160 us/layer` for a plausible `200 tok/s` non-speculative lane.
